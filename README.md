# Speed trumpet mouthpiece beta ðŸŽº 

## Lily (Solo)
upgraded version of the CKB 7E Mouthpiece. It worked flawlessly, and the STL file at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:291388 greatly aided me in designing it because the original is quite difficult to find. It has evolved into one of my favorite solo mouthpieces, with a clean, dazzling tone, after numerous adjustments. It provides a responsive and effortless playing experience across all registers, making it extremely free blowing.

## Sakura (Orchestra)
rich core sound great for orchestra produced by stacking 7E and 2C cups together using the new technique I invented, called finstack cup. However, there is still some sparkling bright tone present.
